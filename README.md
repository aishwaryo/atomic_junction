# atomic_junction
Codes from manuscript "Machine-learning prediction on formation of atomic gold wires by mechanically controlled break junction"

The autoencoder model is provided in final_code.py.

Output from the code layer of our model is saved to layer_output.csv.

The data extracted from all recorded traces to find optimal speed and bias is included in datafile_lowtemp_final.csv.
